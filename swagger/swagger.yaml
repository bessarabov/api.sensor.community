    ## About this documentation

    This is an unofficial documentation of the API that is used in the project [https://sensor.community](https://sensor.community).

    The source code of this documentation is at [https://github.com/bessarabov/api.sensor.community](https://github.com/bessarabov/api.sensor.community). Feel free to create Pull Request with bug fixes or improvements.

    Maybe, someday this API documentation will be adopted as official and it will be shown at [https://api.sensor.community](https://api.sensor.community) and the source code will be moved to [https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart). But for now this is just an unofficial attempt to create documentation.

    This documentation is created with openapi/swagger. It is interactive. You can enter values in for the endpoints and see here the results of the requests right in the browser.

    ## Other documentations

    Now there are several places where API is described:

     * [https://api.sensor.community/v1/](https://api.sensor.community/v1/)
     * [https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/EN-APIs](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/EN-APIs)

    ## Sensor data object

    Many endpoints return sensor data. It is a JSON object, here is an example:

    `timestamp` is in UTC

      ```
      {
        "id": 6489703325,
        "timestamp": "2021-08-14 16:09:32",
        "sampling_rate": null,
        "location": {
          "longitude": "11.576",
          "latitude": "48.12",
          "id": 231,
          "country": "DE",
          "indoor": 0,
          "exact_location": 0,
          "altitude": "516.9"
        },
        "sensor": {
          "id": 489,
          "sensor_type": {
            "id": 14,
            "name": "SDS011",
            "manufacturer": "Nova Fitness"
          },
          "pin": "1"
        },
        "sensordatavalues": [
          {
            "id": 14216406071,
            "value_type": "P1",
            "value": "11.53"
          },
          {
            "id": 14216406074,
            "value_type": "P2",
            "value": "8.70"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
