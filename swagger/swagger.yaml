    ## About this documentation

    This is an unofficial documentation of the API that is used in the project [https://sensor.community](https://sensor.community).

    The source code of this documentation is at [https://github.com/bessarabov/api.sensor.community](https://github.com/bessarabov/api.sensor.community). Feel free to create Pull Request with bug fixes or improvements.

    Maybe, someday this API documentation will be adopted as official and it will be shown at [https://api.sensor.community](https://api.sensor.community) and the source code will be moved to [https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart). But for now this is unofficial documentation.

    This documentation is created with openapi/swagger. It is interactive. For some endpoints you can send requests and see the responses directly on this page.

    ## Official documentation

    Now there are several official places with official documentation:

     * [https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/EN-APIs](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/EN-APIs)
     * [https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/APIs](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/APIs) — in German language
     * [https://api.sensor.community/v1/](https://api.sensor.community/v1/)
     * [For a description of the standard firmware](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/sensors-software/blob/master/airrohr-firmware/Readme.md)

    ## Terminology

     * measurement station — device that measure data. Sometimes it is called "node". There may be multiple sensors in one measurement station (e.g. PM and temperature/humidity).
     * sensor — element of the measurement station that does the measurements. Sensor often measure several different values. For example particulate matter sensor SDS011 measure two values: PM2.5 and PM10. One more example: sensor BME280 measures temperature, humidity and pressure.

    In this API there are a lot of different IDs. There is a huge problem with the naming of IDs. In different parts of sensor.community the same things are named differently and the different things are named the same way. Here is an unofficial attempt to name all that things:

     * `StationNumber` — (example `37831`) this is just a number. It is created by sensor.community when you register your measurement station at [https://devices.sensor.community/](https://devices.sensor.community/) This number is incremental. One person register new station — get StationNumber = 37831, the next person register new station — get StationNumber = 37832.
     * `StationUniqID` — (example `esp8266-123456789` or `raspi-3b4838fa`). Sometimes it is called `ChipID` and on the site [https://devices.sensor.community/sensors](https://devices.sensor.community/sensors) is called `Sensor UID`
     * `SensorID` (example `44700`) — This is the ID that you see on the map [https://sensor.community](https://sensor.community)

    Here is an example. There can be a measurement station with StationNumber = 37831, StationUniqID = esp8266-123456789 that has connected two sensors:

      * SensorID = 44700 that measures PM2.5 & PM10
      * SensorID = 44701 that measures temperature, humidity and pressure

    ## Measurements data object

    Many endpoints return measurements data. It is a JSON object, here is an example:

    ```
    {
      "id": 6489703325,
      "timestamp": "2021-08-14 16:09:32",
      "sampling_rate": null,
      "sensor": {
        "id": 489,
        "sensor_type": {
          "id": 14,
          "name": "SDS011",
          "manufacturer": "Nova Fitness"
        },
        "pin": "1"
      },
      "sensordatavalues": [
        {
          "id": 14216406071,
          "value_type": "P1",
          "value": "11.53"
        },
        {
          "id": 14216406074,
          "value_type": "P2",
          "value": "8.70"
        }
      ],
      "location": {
        "longitude": "11.576",
        "latitude": "48.12",
        "id": 231,
        "country": "DE",
        "indoor": 0,
        "exact_location": 0,
        "altitude": "516.9"
      }
    }
    ```

    * `id` — MeasurementID, this ID you get after POST-ing data to endpoint `/v1/push-sensor-data/`
    * `timestamp` is in UTC
    * `sampling_rate` — there are vey few measurement station that send data to this field, it is usually `null`
    * `sensor.id` — SensorID
    * `sensor.sensor_type` — 14 for SDS011, 17 for BME280 and a lot of other options (See below for the full list)
    * `sensor.pin` — this is the value that was sent in header `X-Pin` to endpoint `/v1/push-sensor-data/`
    * `sensordatavalues.id` — MeasurementValueID
    * `sensordatavalues.value_type` — P1 for PM10, PM2 for PM2.5 and a lot of other options (Where to get the full list UNKNOWN FIXME)
    * `location.id` — UNKNOWN FIXME

    ## How to send data to sensor.community

     * Read the section "Terminology" to understand the basic concepts
     * Register at the site [https://devices.sensor.community/](https://devices.sensor.community/)
     * Go to [https://devices.sensor.community/sensors/register](https://devices.sensor.community/sensors/register). It is called "Sensor registration", but actually it is registration of the "measurement station" and the sensors that are connected to it. In the field "Sensor ID" you need to enter the numbers from `StationUniqID`. If you are using ESP8266 or ESP32 and know how to find out ChipID of this board, you can use that number, If you are using raspberry PI you can enter value of the `Serial` field from the file `/proc/cpuinfo`. Or you can generate a big random number and use it.
     * Read documentation of endpoint `/v1/push-sensor-data/` and use it to send data
     * After sending data check that you see your data at `/airrohr/v1/sensor/{SensorID}/` (It take about a minute or two after sending data to `/v1/push-sensor-data/` to see it at `/airrohr/v1/sensor/{SensorID}/`)

      summary: Get info from one sensor for the last 5 minutes
      description: |
        With this endpoint you get get all the measures of the last 5 minutes for the the specific sensor. You can find sensor ID with the map [https://sensor.community](https://sensor.community).Usually there are 2 measures in the endpoint response.

        Don't forget to specify the slash (`/`) after sensor ID, without it the endpoint will return 404.

        The source code of this endpoint is available at GitHub repo — UNKNOWN FIXME

        The response is the JSON array with zero or more JSON sensor data objects.

      summary: Get info from sensors filtered by `query` for the last 5 minutes

      tags:
        - data

      description: |
        `query`:

          * `type={sensor type}` : comma-separated list of sensor types, e.g. SDS011,BME280
          * `area={lat,lon,distance}` : all sensors within a max radius e.g. 52.5200,13.4050,10 (Berlin). The unit of measurements of `distance` is UNKNOWN FIXME
          * `box={lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2}` : all sensors in a 'box' with the given coordinates e.g. 52.1,13.0,53.5,13.5
          * `country={country code}` : comma-separated list of country codes. Example BE,DE,NL

         `query` option is a strange thing. This is not query part of URL, this is the part of pathname.
         You can't specify `/airrohr/v1/filter/?type=BME280`, you need to use `/airrohr/v1/filter/type=BME280`, but you can specify server queries: `/airrohr/v1/filter/type=BME280&country=IN`
